=== This is railsesque (and it is railesque!)

- What is it?
  - A simple, easy, 30KB, full!, railsesque PHP framework.
  - Includes niceties like ORM and form builders.
  - Even a script/generate interface (in a later release)
  - Does not include billions of files
  - Downloadable hiphop-php version that is FASSSTT
  - Standard, easy, you-already-know-it MVC
  - Rails-inspired (_read:_ stolen directly from) method names.
